# keygem

A very early rough draft of custom keyboard inspired by the Writing Tools project with real-time text transformations using the Gemini API.
Also supports summarization and customs prompt. 
It is a complement to the IOS port of the Writing tools project. https://github.com/Joaov41/tools

Due to IOS sandboxing, it is not possible to have inline replacement of text on the IOS port, the only way to achive this was through a custom keyboard.So both apps complement each other.
